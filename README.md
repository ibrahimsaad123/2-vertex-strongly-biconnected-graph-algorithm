# 2-vertex-strongly-biconnected-graph-algorithm

Task
Step 1: Implementation of the Cheriyan-Mehlhorn-Gabow Algorithm
An implementation of the Cheriyan-Mehlhorn-Gabow algorithm for finding strongly connected components of a directed graph in linear time.

Step 2: Implementation of Jens Schmidt's Algorithm
An implementation of Jens Schmidt's algorithm for testing whether an undirected graph is 2-connected (i.e., it has no articulation points) in linear time.

Step 3: Testing for 2-Vertex Strongly Biconnected Graphs
Testing whether a directed graph is 2-vertex strongly biconnected or not in O(n(n+m)) time.

Definition
A directed graph 𝐺
G is 2-vertex strongly biconnected if it has at least three vertices and 
G∖{w} is strongly biconnected for all vertices 𝑤 in 𝐺.
